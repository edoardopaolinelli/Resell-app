### Layout
Once logged in, the user is redirected to the viewing screen of all products, where they can add the different products to the cart, choose their favorites, view the details of each product and filter the products between favorites and not. In the side Drawer the user can manage the various products he has loaded, and load others; view the list of your orders or log out.

### Cart
All orders go through the shopping cart, where the user can cancel the item from the cart or confirm their orders one last time before they are placed.

##
### Database
All data relating to the products loaded, the orders placed and the products included in the favorites, are saved on a RealTimeDatabase and loaded from it.



##
### Used technologies
For the realization of the project I used Flutter and Firebase.
